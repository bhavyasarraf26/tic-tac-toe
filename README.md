# Tic-Tac-Toe

**Tic-Tac-Toe** (also called *noughts and crosses* or *Xs and Os*) is
a simple, two-player game that is traditionally played by
drawing a 3-by-3 grid on paper, and it can be played on a
computer or on a variety of media as well.

In a 3-by-3 grid game, the player who is playing "X" always
goes first. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board
until either player has three in a row, horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally or until all squares on the grid
are filled. If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os
in a row, then that player wins. If all squares are filled and
neither player has made a complete row of Xs or Os, then the game
is a draw.
